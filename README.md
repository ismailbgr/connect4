This project was made for my YAP 441 - Artificial Intelligence class at the TOBB University of Economics and Technology.

It is a simple project that uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the AI. The AI is able to play against itself and against a human player. The AI is also able to play against itself and determine the best move in a given amount of time.
